My friend wrote a pretty cool program that can encrypt/decrypt any file type. I wanted to see if I could replicate it. 

I know this can handle every file type, but it's not a very good encryption algorithm. My friend's does some bit manipulation, so I'll come back to this once I understand that stuff in some more detail.

Should probably include a GUI for this as well...clicking and dragging a file onto a .jar is quite a pain.
